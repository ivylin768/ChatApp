# ChatApp
Chat App Created Records While Learning Android Studio


## The app in *1155131776_a1.zip* has the following features

• Two activities (Main Activity and Chat Activity)

• There is a button on Main Activity which will allow the user to enter the Chat Activity

• The Chat Activity has a back button on the Action Bar, allowing the user to go back to the Main Activity

• The Chat Activity consists of a ListView for listing past messages, an EditText for user input, 
and an ImageButton or ImageView for user to send the message.

• Each item in the ListView should contain two elements, one is the message itself,
another is the time (HH:MM) when the message is sent

• When the user clicks on the send button, the app should perform the following actions:

o Check if the user has input any text (i.e. check whether the input area is empty)

o If the user has input some text, add a new item containing the message to the 
end of the ListView; and then clear the input area
